# patchbae
Like tracking your synth and drum machine patches in a spreadsheet, but filter by tags, categories.

Columns:
_Name_: What is its saved name?
_Instrument_: Which device?
_Address_: Where is it stored on the device?
_Family_: Variations of one root patch.

_Friends_: What sounds good together?
